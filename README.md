# Python-Ethical-Hacking
This repository is a portfolio of Ethical Hacking projects that I built using what I learned in a few different classes.

Credit goes to: "Learn Python and Ethical Hacking From Scratch" by Zaid Sabih and z Security.

Zaid from z Security was the primary lecturer for this class and I followed what we learned closely for my code, however, I did write this code myself as some of the versions in the course were out of date or things had to be debugged.
